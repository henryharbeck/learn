    # Loading Data

    _By [etrotta](https://github.com/etrotta)._

    This tutorial covers how to load data of varying formats and from different sources using [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/).

    It includes examples of how to load and write to a variety of formats, shows how to convert data from other libraries to support formats not supported directly by polars, includes relevant links for users that need to connect with external sources, and explains how to deal with custom formats via plugins.

    ### Creating your own Plugin

    The simplest form of plugins are essentially generators that yield DataFrames.

    Without parsing filters you will be missing on performance improvements, but even just this can help improve your performance in many cases as it allows for polars to optimize the query and request data in batches as opposed to always loading everything in memory.

    Below is a example plugin which just takes the product between multiple iterables, some highlights are that:

    - You must use `register_io_source` for polars to create the LazyFrame which will consume the Generator
    - You are expected to provide a Schema before the Generator starts
    - - For many use cases the Plugin may be able to infer it, but you could also pass it explicitly to the plugin function 
    - Ideally you should parse some of the filters and column selectors to avoid unnecessary work, but it is possible to delegate that to polars after loading the data in order to keep it simpler (at the cost of efficiency)

    Efficiently parsing the filter expressions is out of the scope for this notebook.
